      ##Ladies Learning Code: Building a store with Shopify

      <br>
      #Schedule

      <strong> Important note:</strong>
      This is a guideline, not a rule! It is more important that the learners are following along then it is to get to the end of the slides!

      <em>Please note</em>: this schedule is for a single day workshop.
      If you are leading two weekday evenings, you can split this schedule up accordingly. Please remember to take a 15-30 minute break on both days. The first 15-20 minutes of the second day should be allocated for review and questions from the prior session.

      * <strong> (10:00 am - 11:00 am)</strong>:
      * <strong> (11:00 am - 12:30 pm)</strong>:
      * <strong>Lunch Break! (12:30 pm - 1:30 pm)</strong>
      * <strong> (1:30 pm -2:00 pm)</strong>:
      * <strong> (2:00 pm - 2:30 pm)</strong>:
      * <strong> (2:30 pm - 3:30 pm)</strong>:
      * <strong> (3:30 pm - 4:00 pm)</strong>:

      #General Notes

      * <strong>Important!</strong> Please give learners enough time to download learner files from slide 1 - check in as people are entering the room to make sure they have learner files.

      * A common issue with leaner files - make sure Windows users extract the folder. If a learner sees the slides without any styles, that is probably why.
      * To create a Partner account with Shopify, learners will be asked for PayPal information. They will not be charged anything for the creation of the account. A Partner account is used by theme and app developers, so the PayPal information is required for the Partner to get paid!

      #Specific Examples

      <h2>Notes</h2>

      <strong>Slide 4: (Shopify Logo)</strong>
      Shopify will let you securely sell goods both online and in-store.
      Shopify takes care of hosting your files, maintaining a database of your products and sales, and making sure financial transactions are secure - a lot of the obstacles to setting up a viable online business are taken care of. Started in Ottawa, Ontario.

      <strong>Slide: 5 & 6 (Brand Logos)</strong>
      It's used by many well known and popular brands

      <strong>Slide 7: Today's Goal</strong>
      Liquid is a Ruby-based coding language that was created by Shopify.
      It is predominately a "templating language" - it's going to make
      developing themes relatively simple.

      <strong>Slide 11: Shopify Partner Account</strong>
      The Shopify Partners program is marketed as a way to earn some client revenue and get access to additional resources. It's also useful for people just starting out because it lets you create development shops and work on them as long as you'd like before you're ready to "go live" and begin a plan.

      <strong>Slide 12: I'm a Partner now. What does that mean?</strong>
      When you "finish" a dev shop, you transfer it to a merchant and from there it's up to the merchant whether you have access. Incoming payments from revenue sharing modal when you setup stores for people who become paying Shopify merchants, when people buy the themes you've designed, or lease the the Apps you've made.

      <strong>Slide 13: Create a new development store</strong>
      When you make your store choose ONLINE store only.

      <strong>Slide 14: (Shopify Dashboard)</strong>
      Under Sales Channel, choose Online Store.  The Online store is just one of a handful of Channels your store can have. Other examples include Facebook and Point of sale devices, and Buy Button.

      In the bottom of the sidebar, there's another menu of links to resources.

      <strong>Slide 16: Uploading CSV file</strong>
      Depending on the size of your inventory, importing files from a CSV can be simpler to maintain then adding each product manually through the Shopify interface. Some people are more familiar and comfortable with applications that write CSV files to speed up the data entry process

      <strong>Slide 17: (No title, product detail screenshot)</strong>
      Point out how detailed the description is in the product details. It's helpful to think of the kinds of words people would search for when looking for an item and using those keywords in the body of the description.

      Click on the view button and walk the class through some of the common
      product page elements:
      <ul>
        <li>Tags - Add as many as you want, used for sorting later.</li>
        <li>Multiple images</li>
        <li>Compare at price - how to tell Shopify if an item is On Sale</li>
        <li>Inventory policy: Can tell whether you want Shopify to keep track of the inventory.</li>
        <li>SEO: What it's going to look like for search engines.</li>
      </ul>

      <strong>Slide 18: Themes</strong>
      Your Shopify store is really just a database of products, collections, etc.  But your store's theme is what you and customers "see" when they visit your site.

      <strong>Slide 23: (Editor Screenshot)</strong>
      If you aren't seeing this screen, it's probably because your store is using the "old" editor.
      Instead of "editor", the URL will end in "settings".

      You can upgrade to the new one from the main dashboard.

      <strong>Slide 24: Exercise #1: Get to know your theme</strong>
      Do the first couple changes with the class, then leave this list up.

      Give class time to experiment with edits, mentors can help them go through the list.

      <strong>Slide 39: Exercise #2: More theme customizations</strong>
      Do the first couple changes with the class, then leave this list up.

      Give class time to experiment with edits, mentors can help them go through the list.

      <strong>Slide 39: Language editor</strong>
      "Hard Coding" is industry jargon, so explain what this means. We can now have dymanic content as opposed to fixed text within the code that will be harder to edit. If you want to change something, you just have to login into Shopify and change the page. No need to go into the theme files. More on this in the next slide.

      <strong> Slide 40:</strong>
      This may be the first time a learner has seen HTML. Take a moment to point out the pair of tags, what the tags in this example mean, and poinnt out the syntax.

      <strong>Slide 41: How does liquid help?</strong>

      Explain that {{ }} are called handlebars - they are pretty common with templating languages.
      They tell Shopify that this is a liquid object, so go look this up.

      <strong>Slide 43: Exercise #3: Break something on purpose</strong>
      Explain directories briefly. Just another word for folder.

      <strong>Slide 47: Break smarter</strong>
      The ability to make duplicates and easily switch between them is a huge advantage with Shopify.  Mistakes are less costly than with some other content management systems.

      <strong>Slide 48: Break</strong>
      Let the break be an opportunity to step away from the computer if learners need to do that, or use this time to take advantage of their mentors and fellow classmates' time.

      <strong>Slide 50: (Template image)</strong>
      There are a lot of parts to a website, but you only need to work in small chunks at a time.  Knowing how templates work makes it more manageable, and saves you a lot of work.

      <strong>Slide 52: Template files</strong>
      Differantiate a theme from a template. A theme is a collection of template files.

      <strong>Slide 57: Pages</strong>
      Ask the learners what type of content they would put in a sidebar

      <strong>Slide 58: Exercise #4: Intro to liquid objects</strong>
      Briefly discuss the importance of referencing and reading documentation. Memorization is not as important as knowing how to look up the information you need.
      Remind class it's about incremental steps - don't try both of these in one change.

      <strong>Slide 66: Break</strong>
      This is their first time seeing an <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> tag, so briefly explain what this is since they will be creating one of their own soon.

      <strong>Slide 69: Exercise #5</strong>
      Explain that a "call to action" is another word for a button. It draws the user in and calls them to "do" something

      <strong>Slide 77: Exercise #6</strong>
      Explain what a hero image is.

      <strong>Slide 83: Screenshots of masthead images, with one broken</strong>
      Some collections don't have hero images, so those will show a blank area where the image would be.

      <strong>Slide 85: Break</strong>
      Pseudo code will describe the logic of what you will do, one step at a time, without worrying about having perfect syntax. It's kind of like a rough draft to get your ideas out without worrying about the grammar quite yet.

      <strong>Slide 87: Exercise #6</strong>
      See if you can get the class to give you the answer to the three questions.
      Let learners work out the for-loop and the if-statement on their own/with a mentor.

      <strong>Slide 88: Logic Operators</strong>
      Open up operators link and briefly go over it.

      <strong>Slide 92: Introducing the For-loop</strong>
      See if you can get the class to give you the answer to the three questions.

      <strong>Slide 106: Theme tags</strong>
      ???We are clicking ABOVE the product rows because we want to know
      what the HTML element is that BEGINS the products photo rows.???
